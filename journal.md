I need to gather data to trian my model. I couldnt exactly find a dataset that has what I need. I have created a script to Scrpae Quran 411 and get a json file of each chapter and its verses. I now need to find the corresponding audio to pair with the transliteraions.

I found a site that lets me download a zip file of Quran recitation mp3. Everyayah.com lets me download them verse by verse so its easier to access.
11.44PM
Used a little python script to organize the audio files into folders with each surah's verses.

I am considering working with Whisper or Google's speech to text to transcribe recitations to text. 
This will then be used to train my model.
